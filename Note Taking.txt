[1] Tries 1-3: Overfitted model, peaked 70% accuracy on test set w/ like 99% training           (20 epoch)

[2] (OUTDATED) Try 4: Tried Freezing approach, needs more epochs than 20.  Final: 67 / 94       (20 epoch)

[1] Try 5: Needs more epochs than 20, didn't overfit but just needs more time.  Final: 67 / 90  (15 epoch)

Goals for 24/2/23:
Set Epochs to 50 and let [1] just run forever with lr=le-4
